**Description:** Complete documentation on Anthropic's multi-agent research system architecture, implementation principles, and best practices.

## Overview

Anthropic has developed a sophisticated multi-agent research system that leverages an "orchestrator-worker pattern" to tackle complex research queries. This system uses a lead agent that coordinates the research process by delegating specialized tasks to subagents, which operate in parallel to explore different aspects of a research problem.

## Core Architecture

### Orchestrator-Worker Pattern

The multi-agent system follows a hierarchical structure:

- **Lead Agent (Orchestrator):** Coordinates the overall research process, delegates tasks, and synthesizes findings
- **Subagents (Workers):** Specialized agents that focus on specific aspects of the research query
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple subagents work simultaneously across different context windows
- **Dynamic Strategy:** Adaptive search approach that can pivot and explore tangential connections

### Key Differentiators

Unlike traditional static retrieval systems, this multi-agent approach offers:

1. **Flexibility:** Ability to explore complex, open-ended research problems
2. **Adaptability:** Can pivot strategy based on intermediate findings
3. **Parallel Exploration:** Multiple agents explore different aspects simultaneously
4. **Context Expansion:** Operates across multiple context windows for broader information access
5. **Insight Compression:** Synthesizes findings from large information corpora

## Technical Implementation

### Prompt Engineering Principles

Effective multi-agent systems require sophisticated prompt engineering:

#### Task Description Development
- Create detailed, specific task descriptions for each subagent
- Define clear objectives and success criteria
- Establish boundaries and constraints for agent behavior
- Scale effort appropriately based on query complexity

#### Extended Thinking Mode
- Enable visible reasoning processes for transparency
- Allow agents to show their work and decision-making
- Facilitate debugging and system improvement
- Enhance interpretability of agent actions

#### Agent Coordination Guidelines
- Establish clear communication protocols between agents
- Define handoff procedures and data sharing methods
- Create explicit coordination rules and responsibilities
- Implement conflict resolution mechanisms

#### Self-Improvement Capabilities
- Allow agents to refine their own prompts based on performance
- Enable learning from previous interactions and outcomes
- Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Support adaptive behavior based on task requirements

### Evaluation Strategies

#### Testing Methodologies
- **Small Sample Initial Testing:** Start with limited test cases for rapid iteration
- **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation:** Use language models to assess output quality
- **End-State Focus:** Evaluate final results rather than step-by-step processes
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combine automated and human evaluation methods

#### Performance Metrics
